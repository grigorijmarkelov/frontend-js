	      <blockquote><p><i>Edsger Dijkstra, one of the giants of our field and a passionate believer in the mathematical view of programs and programming.Over the previous quarter-century, he had formulated many of the great intellectual challenges of the field as programming the goto statement, structured programming,concurrent processes,semaphores,deadlocks, and deriving correct programs.</i></p>

		<p><strong>Edsger Wybe Dijkstra</strong> - was a profound computer scientist at the same time being a practical sharp programmer.His great understanding of disciplines related with computations and true face of program art made him widely famous within both scientific and coder communities.  </p>
		<p>At those mid-century times computer programming even wasn't recognized as a serious academic discipline.But Dijkstra having a solid mathematical background was able to see the future perspectives in programming area and became the driver of program development methods.Many computer involved people knows Dijkstra's greedy algorithm for solving shortest path problem.It so successful that even now often used in web communication through router chaining(so called "hops").</p>
		<p>From the fundamental point of view Dijkstra's efforts greatly help to broad community in realizing that <b><i>program debugging can be largely avoided through careful design.</i></b>
		The term "Structured programming" was also greatly inspired by a coauthored with R.Hoare and O.J.Dahl book written in 1972 where Dijkstra establishes ground for disciplined higher-level structures which at first should manage the flow of execution of programs.
		And beyond all of this he was an early pioneer of research on principles of distributed computing.Dijkstra saw the benefits of distributed programming and in 1965 he wrote a paper "Solution of a Problem in Concurrent Programming Control" where the mutex concept was highlighted.</p>
		<p>The last large note to say is Dijkstra's ingenious view of "computing science" correctness.Instead of the "computer technology" term he uncovers the importance the abstract mechanisms that computing science uses to master needed complexity.
		This modest genious man deserves to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra">read about his workings much more</a> than short excerpts, just look.</p>
